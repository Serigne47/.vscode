This becomes part of Quotation Table in 2025 and you will find columns from [117] to [128] replacing 2 files mentioned above. \n\nGENERAL\n\nThe Freight Services Providers are free to choose the Routes for quotation, there is no requirement to quote all Routes or all Routes per Template, however, there is needed minimum scale to represent potential for allocation. \n\nRoutes omitted for quotation should be left unfilled - empty. In case any Route is quoted the Transporeon tool will require all cells in given Route to be filled in. \n\nFor very specific cases, where the cell is required to be left empty it should be filled in with dummy “99999” to make it identifiable while analyzing the offers.\n\nThe Freight Services Providers are required to quote following the pricing breakdown included in the quotation templates. Offers totaled without details will not be considered. Reckitt reserves the right to exclude from the scope of Services some quoted Services while allocating therefore each quoted position should reflect correctly the costs related to that Service.\n\nAll Charges quoted at zero (0) will be treated as the service offered free of any charge.",
